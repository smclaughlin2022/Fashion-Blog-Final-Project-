          My name is Sydney McLaughlin, I am a 21 year old entrepreneurship
          major at Babson College. I was originally born in Sydney, Australia.
          After moving to the states around the age of three (missing out on a
          cool Aussie accent) I spent most of my childhood in DoverSherborn
          Massachusetts. In high school I was introduced to the idea of
          sustainability in my Environmental studies class and my interest was
          further peaked in my Marine Biology class. An early passion for the
          environment and sustainable businesses bloomed and I decided to
          continue my studies at Babson College in Wellesley MA.
          <br />
          Babson seemed like the perfect choice for me as I had always wanted to
          follow in my father's footsteps and create my own business.
          Specifically a business that could help in the fight against climate
          change and the destruction of our planet whose beauty I gained a deep
          appreciation for at a very young age. Babson was known for its
          entrepreneurship and I hoped I could find a way to bridge my passion
          for the environment and dream of starting a business. Babson has and
          is still a great school that has helped me propel my ideas and further
          my education in my areas of interest. Obviously climate change is a
          large topic that has many different factors and industries that
          contribute to the overall problem. In my Entrepreneurship in Fashion
          class, I discovered that the fashion industry is responsible for 10%
          of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions and is the world's
          second-largest clean water polluter, producing over 21 billion tons of
          waste each year. The fashion industry itself is responsible for more
          annual carbon emissions than all international flights and shipping
          combined, with an expected increase of 50% in the next decade. These
          figures we shocking and can be attributed the trend of "fast fashion."
          Realizing this issue and understanding that it has become the
          consumer's responsibility to reduce these figures can be a hard pill
          to swallow and often extremely difficult.

          That is why I have created this webpage, as a resource for people like
          myself, who love fashion but want to practice fashion in a sustainable
          way. I have always been in love with fashion, but it directly
          interfered with my love for the environment so I wanted to find a
          solution to bring the two together. There are many solutions to the
          fashion problem such as circular business models, thrifting, and
          upscaling, all which I will discuss on this webpage. However, there
          are imitations to these solutions and often times they can be
          unrealistic when searching for a specific product, style or look. This
          webpage pushes pass those limitations it features the trendiest items
          of the season and shows where you can get these products from
          sustainable companies. Hopefully, it will take the hassle and
          excessive research needed to find sustainable products, and readers
          can get the best of both words.

          Eventually, my goal is to bring the ideas of this webpage and turn it
          into a company. My idea is to create and extension, similar to "Honey"
          the coupon browser extension. Similarly to Honey, my extension would
          provide a pop up-like window when shopping on large retailers like
          Amazon or Walmart. The pop up window would take in the information of
          the product the user is looking at and use an algorithm or database to
          find a similar product that is sustainably made. This extension would
          eliminate all the in-between steps and show side by sides of the same
          product, with a price comparison, and direct link to the company that
          is producing the sustainable alternative. This idea is its beginning
          stages but it would be my dream to launch something of this nature
          after I graduate. I hope to build up content around the topic in the
          meantime. Have fun exploring my pages!
