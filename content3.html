            Patagonia was one of the first companies to put environmental ethics at the forefront of their values. 
            They also were one of the first companies to use recycled materials and make the 
            jump to organic cotton. As a company they are deeply committed to labor ethics and 
            prefer to work out of US factories when possible. They have factories in states such as 
            Texas and North Carolina. Their continued commitment has shined a much needed light on
            the necessity for companies to make a positive impact and serves as the gold standard for fair 
            trade and fair trade factories worldwide.
