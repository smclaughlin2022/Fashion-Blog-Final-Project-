    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      In this project I will be researching and selecting the top fashion items
      trending this season. Once I have identified a popular garment, trend,
      style or product I will research and provide information on a sustainable
      alternative consumers can by instead. My readers will be able to use this
      website to buy trendy clothes that align their values. Other readers can
      use this website to alter their shopping behavior and access easy
      information to help change online shopping into a more sustainable
      practice.
    </p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>
      The objective of this website is to take the hassle and research out of
      locating sustainable alternatives. Many like myself would love to shop
      sustainably. However, the problem is, fast fashion and other large
      retailers dominate the online shopping world. Accessible information on
      sustainable business and companies is limited or hard to find. This
      website will bridge that gap and combine fashion lovers and sustainable
      shopping.
    </p>

    <h3>Target Audience</h3>
    <p>
      plan to target, fashion lovers and people who love to shop online. My
      target audience would consist of three attributes. The targeted age group
      would be
      <a
        href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=E-commerce_statistics_for_individuals#:~:text=The%20largest%20proportion%20of%20people,two%20times%20(35%20%25)."
        >16 to 25 years old</a
      >. Data shows that is the age group that tends to shop online the most!
      The second attribute will be income. Online shoppers have
      higher-than-typical incomes, 55% of online shoppers making

      >
        $75,000 a year</a
      >. My last attribute will be consumer values. I will be targeting people
      who want to shop sustainably. Research shows 2 out of five US online
      consumers prefer to

        >shop sustainably</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h4>Content Plan</h4>
    <p>
      I plan to include content surrounding the fashion garment I have chosen to
      find alternatives for and why. This first section will be supplemented
      with images, sources, and hyperlinks. I also plan to include content on
      myself, my goals for this website as well as important definitions like
      what I mean by "sustainability." I also have interest in providing content
      on why it is important to shop sustainably, the impact of fast fashion,
      sustainable companies, and how the fashion world is changing. All this
      content will be supplemented with images, sources, website links,
      hyperlinks and potentially a podcast version of the content.
